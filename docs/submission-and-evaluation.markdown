## Submission
### **Model Submission Requirements**:
Please provide your solution to [TBD](). Each team can submit multiple times and we will only use the latest version you submit. Your models and scripts should be accessible and runnable. 

### **Paper Submission Requirements**:
Each team should submit short papers with 3 complimentary pages and up to 2 extra pages, including all figures, tables, and references. The paper submission is through [the special track]() and should follow its instructions. Please include AI4Science and Art Contest Task 1/2” in your abstract.

## Evaluation


### **Paper Assessment**:
The assessment of the paper will be conducted by invited experts and professionals. The judges will independently rate the data and model analysis, robustness and generalizability, innovation and creativity, organization and readability, each accounting for 20% of the qualitative assessment. 

Note that since the paper submission will follow the timeline on the [Special Track]() and the models can be submitted later than the paper, the discussion of results and performance will not be counted in the paper assessment.
